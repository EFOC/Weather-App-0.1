# Weather-App-0.1

### Welcome!

##### OVERVIEW

This is my Weather app. It is 100% written in **Kotlin**. It takes weather data from an API on a server and displays in a list on the app. It also uses Google's Places API to get a list of real life locations.


This app uses:

* Kotlin
* RecyclerView
* Coroutines
* LiveData
* Room Database
* Reftrofit2 framework
* Google Places API - to get the names of cities
* Weather API - to get the weather data of the cities provided
* Uses Loading Spinner while fetching data, disappears after 3 seconds of no updates
* Swipe to delete
